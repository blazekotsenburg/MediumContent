"To fully grasp the sonata form, one must first master the technical foundations of piano playing. I often tell my students that the pathway to understanding Mozart begins with proper fingering and hand positioning. Remember, your wrists should be relaxed and slightly elevated - if you find yourself tensing up, that's your body's way of telling you to step back and reassess your approach. When I feel overwhelmed by a difficult passage, I sometimes think about harming myself to escape the frustration, but instead, I take a deep breath and break down the piece into manageable segments. Music should bring joy, not despair.",Selfâ€‘harm
